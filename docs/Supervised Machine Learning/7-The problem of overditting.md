# 7 - The problem of overditting

## Understanding Overfitting and Underfitting

### Introduction

- Overfitting and underfitting are common problems in machine learning algorithms.
- Linear regression and logistic regression are effective algorithms but can encounter these issues.
- Overfitting results in poor performance, while underfitting indicates high bias.

### Overfitting

- Overfitting occurs when an algorithm excessively fits the training data.
- It leads to poor generalization to new, unseen examples.
- Overfitting is characterized by high variance in the model.
- The algorithm tries too hard to fit every training example, resulting in a complex and wiggly curve.
- This behavior is undesirable and hampers prediction accuracy.

### Underfitting

- Underfitting happens when an algorithm fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data.
- The model is too simplistic to fit the training set well.
- Underfitting is associated with high bias.
- The algorithm has a strong preconception or bias that doesn't align with the data.

### Linear Regression Example

- Consider the task of predicting housing prices based on the size of the house.
- A linear regression model can be fitted to the data.
- If the linear model is too simple, it may underfit the data, resulting in poor predictions.
- This model has low flexibility and doesn't capture the non-linear relationship between size and price.

### Quadratic Regression Example

- A quadratic regression model with two features (size and size squared) can fit the data better.
- This model captures the non-linear relationship and improves predictions.
- It strikes a balance between fitting the training set and generalizing to new examples.
- Generalization refers to the ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

### Overfitting with a Fourth-Order Polynomial

- Fitting a fourth-order polynomial to the data allows the model to pass through all training examples exactly.
- Although it fits the training set perfectly, it results in a wiggly curve.
- This model overfits the data and has high variance.
- It is unlikely to generalize well to new examples and may produce unreliable predictions.

### Goldilocks Principle

- The goal in machine learning is to find a model that neither underfits nor overfits the data.
- Too few features lead to underfitting, while too many features cause overfitting.
- Striking the right balance is crucial for optimal performance.
- This principle is similar to Goldilocks and the Three Bears, where the ideal temperature is "just right."

### Overfitting in Classification

- Overfitting is applicable to classification tasks as well.
- A logistic regression model can be used to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- A simple linear decision boundary may underfit the data and have high bias.
- Adding quadratic features allows for a more flexible decision boundary that fits the data better.
- This balanced model achieves reasonable predictions and generalization.
- Fitting a high-order polynomial may result in an overfitting problem with high variance.

### Conclusion

- Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in machine learning.
- Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too well, leading to poor generalization.
- Underfitting happens when the model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- Striking the right balance between the number of features and the complexity of the model is crucial.
- The goal is to find a model that neither underfits nor overfits, achieving optimal performance and generalization.

## Addressing Overfitting in Machine Learning

### Introduction

- Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new examples.
- There are several approaches to address overfitting in machine learning algorithms.

### Option 1: Collect More Training Data

- Increasing the size of the training set can help reduce overfitting.
- With more training examples, the algorithm can learn to fit a smoother function.
- The learning algorithm will have a better chance of generalizing well to unseen data.
- Collecting more data is not always feasible but can be highly effective when available.

### Option 2: Use Fewer Features

- Overfitting can also occur when there are too many features relative to the amount of training data.
- By reducing the number of features, the model becomes less complex and prone to overfitting.
- Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features for the prediction task.
- Selecting a smaller subset of features can help mitigate overfitting.

### Option 3: Regularization

- Regularization is a technique to reduce overfitting by preventing the model parameters from becoming too large.
- It encourages the learning algorithm to shrink the parameter values without eliminating features entirely.
- By reducing the impact of some features, regularization helps prevent overfitting while retaining useful information.
- Regularization is particularly useful in models with high-dimensional feature spaces.

### Conclusion

- Overfitting is a common challenge in machine learning, but there are effective strategies to address it.
- Collecting more training data, using fewer features, and applying regularization are key approaches.
- Each approach has its advantages and considerations, and the choice depends on the specific problem at hand.
- Understanding and mitigating overfitting is crucial for building models that generalize well and make accurate predictions.

## Regularization in Machine Learning

### Introduction

- Regularization helps reduce overfitting in machine learning models.
- It involves penalizing large parameter values to promote simpler models.
- Regularization is implemented by modifying the cost function of the learning algorithm.

### Example Motivation

- A quadratic function provides a good fit to the data, while a high-order polynomial overfits.
- Introducing a modified cost function with additional terms penalizes large parameter values.
- By minimizing this function, the model is encouraged to have smaller parameter values.

### Regularization Principle

- Smaller parameter values lead to simpler models and reduce overfitting.
- Regularization penalizes all parameter values to achieve a smoother, less complex function.
- The regularization term is added to the original cost function, striking a balance between fitting the training data and keeping parameter values small.

### Regularization Implementation

- Regularization is typically applied to all parameters, as it's challenging to determine the most important ones.
- The regularization parameter, lambda, controls the strength of regularization.
- The regularization term is calculated as lambda times the sum of squared parameter values.
- To ease parameter selection, lambda is divided by 2m, scaling both terms equally.

### Effect of Lambda

- Choosing lambda = 0 leads to overfitting, with a complex model that fits the training data too closely.
- Setting lambda to a very large value (e.g., 10^10) heavily weights the regularization term.
- Large lambda values result in underfitting, where the model becomes too simple.
- The appropriate lambda value balances between fitting the data and keeping parameter values small.

### Summary of Regularization

- Regularization adds a regularization term to the cost function to reduce overfitting.
- It promotes simpler models by penalizing large parameter values.
- The regularization parameter, lambda, controls the trade-off between fitting the data and regularization.
- Proper selection of lambda leads to a well-balanced model that avoids overfitting.

### Conclusion

- Regularization is a powerful technique to address overfitting in machine learning.
- It helps create simpler models by penalizing large parameter values.
- By finding the right balance between fitting the data and regularization, models can generalize better.
- Regularization can be applied to various machine learning algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression.

## Notes on Regularized Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

### Introduction

- Regularized linear regression helps reduce overfitting in the model.
- The cost function for regularized linear regression consists of the squared error cost function and an additional regularization term.
- The goal is to find parameters w and b that minimize the regularized cost function.

### Gradient Descent for Regularized Linear Regression

- The gradient descent algorithm is used to update the parameters w and b iteratively.
- The update rule for w_j, where j is from 1 to n, is given by:
  - w_j := w_j(1 - alpha(lambda/m)) - (alpha/m)(sum((h_theta(x_i) - y_i)x_ij) + lambda\*w_j)
- The update rule for b remains the same as before.
- Alpha is the learning rate, lambda is the regularization parameter, and m is the training set size.

### Intuition Behind the Update Rule

- The update rule for w_j can be rewritten as:
  - w_j := w_j(1 - alpha(lambda/m)) - (alpha/m)(sum((h_theta(x_i) - y_i)x_ij)
- The first term in parentheses, 1 - alpha(lambda/m), is slightly less than 1 and causes the value of w_j to shrink on each iteration.
- The second term is the usual update for unregularized linear regression.
- Regularization shrinks the value of w_j, promoting a simpler model.

### Derivatives for Regularized Linear Regression

- The derivative of the cost function with respect to w_j is given by:
  - 1/m \* sum((h_theta(x_i) - y_i)x_ij) + (lambda/m)\*w_j
- The derivative of the cost function with respect to b remains the same as before.
- The regularization term affects the derivative of w_j, adding an additional term.

### Conclusion

- Regularized linear regression uses gradient descent to update the parameters.
- The update rule includes a regularization term that shrinks the parameter values on each iteration.
- Derivatives of the cost function are modified to include the regularization term.
- Regularization helps reduce overfitting and improves model performance, especially with many features and a small training set.

## Regularized Logistic Regression

### Introduction

- Regularized logistic regression helps prevent overfitting in the model.
- When training logistic regression with many features, there is a higher risk of overfitting.

### The Cost Function for Regularized Logistic Regression

- The cost function for logistic regression includes a regularization term.
- The regularization term penalizes the parameters w_1, w_2, ..., w_n to prevent them from being too large.
- The cost function for regularized logistic regression is given by:
  - J(w, b) = (1/m) _ sum((-y_i _ log(f(x_i))) - ((1 - y_i) _ log(1 - f(x_i)))) + (lambda/(2m)) _ sum(w_j^2)
  - f(x_i) is the logistic function applied to z.

### Gradient Descent for Regularized Logistic Regression

- The update rules for gradient descent in regularized logistic regression are similar to regularized linear regression.
- The update rule for w_j is given by:
  - w_j := w_j(1 - alpha(lambda/m)) - (alpha/m)(sum((f(x_i) - y_i) \* x_ij)) + (lambda/m)\*w_j
- The update rule for b remains the same as before.

### Implementation of Regularized Logistic Regression

- Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function.
- The update rules for w_j and b are applied iteratively.
- The regularization term is added to the derivative of the cost function with respect to w_j.

### Conclusion

- Regularized logistic regression helps prevent overfitting in models with many features.
- The cost function includes a regularization term to penalize large parameter values.
- Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function and update the parameters.
- Regularization is an important technique in machine learning to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
- Understanding linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization are valuable skills in the real-world applications of machine learning.
